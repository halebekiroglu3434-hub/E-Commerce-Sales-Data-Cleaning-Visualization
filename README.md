#Messy E-Commerce Data Cleaning-Visualization & Financial Analysis Pipeline

📌 Project Overview: In this project, I transformed a heavily corrupted e-commerce dataset into actionable business intelligence. The original data contained inconsistent dates, mixed currency formats (USD/TL/EUR), and text-based anomalies

🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python: Pandas, NumPy (For ETL processes) Logging

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

##Techniques: , Anomaly Detection, Data Validation  Normalization Data Cleaning & Normalization
Normalized inconsistent date formats using controlled datetime parsing (errors="coerce")
Applied rule-based string cleaning for numeric fields without forcing regex-based solutions
Separated numeric values from contextual metadata (currency)
Verified price consistency using UnitPrice × Quantity ≈ TotalPrice
Flagged invalid or ambiguous records rather than auto-correcting them
Regex was intentionally avoided in the main pipeline to improve readability. A minimal example is provided for demonstration purposes.
